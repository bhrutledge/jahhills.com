============

Reboot of [hallelujahthehills.com](http://hallelujahthehills.com) using Django
1.7.

As with the
[first iteration](http://github.com/bhrutledge/hallelujahthehills.com), this is
an exercise in using the framework. This time around, the focus is on
[test-driven development](http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/),
[best practices](http://twoscoopspress.org/collections/everything/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-6), and
[YAGNI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren't_gonna_need_it).
