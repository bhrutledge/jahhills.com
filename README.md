# jahhills.com

Reboot of [hallelujahthehills.com](http://hallelujahthehills.com) using the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) web framework and the [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/) family of SASS libraries.

Launched on April 12, 2016, in conjunction with the band's fifth album, [A Band Is Something To Figure Out](http://hallelujahthehills.com/music/a-band-is-something-to-figure-out/).

As with the [first iteration](http://github.com/bhrutledge/hallelujahthehills.com), this is an exercise in using the framework. This time around, the focus is on [test-driven development](http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/), [best practices](http://twoscoopspress.org/collections/everything/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-11), and [YAGNI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren't_gonna_need_it). Launched as an [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product), with enhancements and bugs across the stack tracked in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/bhrutledge/jahhills.com/issues).

Deployed as a [static site](https://github.com/bhrutledge/jahhills.com/pull/142) to minimize server requirements.

Anyone is welcome to [explore the data](./data/README.md).
