============

Reboot of `hallelujahthehills.com <http://hallelujahthehills.com>`_ using Django
1.7.

As with the
`first iteration <http://github.com/bhrutledge/hallelujahthehills.com>`_, this is
an exercise in using the framework. This time around, the focus is on
`test-driven development <http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/>`_,
`best practices <http://twoscoopspress.org/collections/everything/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-6>`_, and
`YAGNI <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren't_gonna_need_it>`_.
