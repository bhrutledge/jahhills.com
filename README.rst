============

Reboot of `hallelujahthehills.com <http://hallelujahthehills.com>`_
using the `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_ web framework 
and the `Bourbon <http://bourbon.io/>`_ family of SASS libraries.

Launched on April 12, 2016, in conjunction with the band's fifth album, `A Band Is Something To Figure Out <http://hallelujahthehills.com/music/a-band-is-something-to-figure-out/>`_.

As with the `first iteration <http://github.com/bhrutledge/hallelujahthehills.com>`_,
this is an exercise in using the framework. This time around, the focus is on
`test-driven development <http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/>`_,
`best practices <http://twoscoopspress.org/collections/everything/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-8>`_,
and `YAGNI <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren't_gonna_need_it>`_.
Launched as a `MVP <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product>`_,
with enhancements and bugs across stack tracked in `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/bhrutledge/jahhills.com/issues>`_.
