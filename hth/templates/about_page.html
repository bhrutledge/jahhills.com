        <p class="content-text">
            Hallelujah The Hills have been releasing critically acclaimed
            albums and touring the U.S. since 2007. Described by Spin as
            “criminally underappreciated” and lauded by Pitchfork for their
            “fist pumping anthems,” they’ve been declared “Boston legends” in
            their hometown and as having a “cult following and pockets of
            hardcore fans scattered throughout the country” by Stereogum. The
            band operates out of Boston, Massachusetts, released their first
            two albums on Misra Records, assisted Titus Andronicus in making
            their breakout album The Monitor, and are one of the only bands to
            have ever toured with The Silver Jews.  Their sound was creatively
            explained as “the kind of punk rock you’d expect on stage at the
            roadhouse from ‘Twin Peaks’ in a recent piece in The Boston Herald.
            Others go further, with Aquarium Drunkard noting “few do it with
            the style and imagination of Hallelujah the Hills” and Captain’s
            Dead boldly publishing that they “without a doubt they are one of
            the greatest bands currently making music.” Their last album,
            2014’s Have You Ever Done Something Evil? was named the #1
            Overlooked Album of the Year by PopMatters and landed the band on
            over a dozen year-end best-of lists. In the press release for their
            first album, they promised to make 33 albums before breaking up.
