Being fond of vinyl and shady, groundless business propositions we said yes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Early Fall 2010 &ndash; We record the two songs for the 7&rdquo; in 24 hours at the Soul Shop recording studio in Medford, MA.  During this session Elio and Ryan place stamp #7/10 on their Asian eatery frequent customer card. They dream of their impending free entr&eacute;e. Joe brings a Johnny Cash record that no of us had ever, ever heard of and insisted we sample it on the B side.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Our mysterious vinyl backer becomes even more elusive when we flat out ask for his/her name because they were omitting it from their emails. The omission, shockingly, is purposeful and the backer asks for us to refer to him or her merely as, &lsquo;F&rsquo;.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>However, this anonymous entrepreneur proves to be fairly worth his or her salt when they promptly pay for the mastering of the two 7&rdquo; songs. Fears which had previously run rampant in the band are somewhat quelled. Lady Gaga wows a nation with second rate David Cronenberg imagery clumsily stapled to average pop music.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>F tells us that the people cutting the vinyl will be done by late January. We book our release show safe in the knowledge that all will work out despite the nutty, non-traditional methods employed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Late Winter 2011 &ndash; The vinyl purveyors stop returning F&rsquo;s emails and phone calls. They post &ldquo;no more orders!&rdquo; on their Facebook and Twitter. No vinyl arrives. Hallelujah The Hills stand side by side on the edge of a road, just about sunset, look off into the distance, and all mutter to themselves, &ldquo;now this? My god, now this?&rdquo;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ryan &amp; Brian begin to attempt to contact the vinyl purveyors by every conceivable method. In a last ditch effort Brian calls an Athens, GA record store and says, &ldquo;Hey, do you know anyone from _______ vinyl?&rdquo; The record store employee surprisingly says, &ldquo;Yes, they&rsquo;re actually browsing the racks here right now!&rdquo;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Brian talks to the vinyl purveyor for a brief 5 minutes. She spins tales of broken machinery, backed up orders, and a harrowing move from Seattle to Athens. She promises to call with another update that very night. She is never heard from again and a communication black out is once again instituted.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ryan calls daily begging for an update whether it&rsquo;s good or bad news. No calls, no vinyl. We&rsquo;re so sorry, friends. The songs can be downloaded on <a href=\"http://hallelujahthehills.bandcamp.com\">Bandcamp</a>. What have I learned from all this? Songs and ideas routinely overcome their format. And a shop name that rhymes with &lsquo;Shingle Fleece Plate&rsquo; vinyl can take a walk until their hat floats. They are no friends of ours. Enjoy the songs. All the best, Hallelujah The Hills.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>"

Or do you want it rambling and metaphorical? Look, I know how to do both so I want you to feel comfortable regardless of your preference. The sessions for the 3rd album have definitely concluded. The artwork has been drafted. The title is decided. But guess what? You gotta mix and master the actual songs which we have yet to do. We're working on it. For this album we started on tape and we're ending digitally and there's some technical alchemy involved that you can't just jump into all willy-nilly. Some more patience never killed anyone. We had a hurricane, we had an earthquake. Summer is awful.</p>\n<p>Want to hear acoustic versions of two new songs, a vague back story for Introductory Saints, and see the band performing in front of a wall of wine? All these things happened at our <a href=\"http://sleepovershows.com/hallelujah-the-hills\">Sleepover Shows</a> session. A little later on Ryan was asked to be <a href=\"http://survivingtheworld.net/GuestLecture15.html\">a guest lecturer</a> on the web-comic Surviving The World. Head lecturer Dante found the spiel acceptable so we promise another installment of the chalk variety of around album release time. Hey, if you haven't discovered it yet we'd like to encourage you to check out the live-interview-show/podcast that Ryan and author <a href=\"http://www.stevenalmond.com/\">Steve Almond</a> host entitled <a href=\"http://thishasbeenadisaster.tumblr.com/\">This Has Been A Disaster - Thanks For Having Us</a>. I bet you wouldn't believe that more stuff happened. Well, it did. Before Hallelujah The Hills there was a band called The Stairs and their entire discography was newly digitized and <a href=\"http://thestairs.bandcamp.com/\">re-released online</a>. Lastly, if you enjoy extremely-specific-niche-awards you need to <a href=\"http://molempire.com/2011/08/17/top-20-album-covers-with-lions-on-them/\">look at this</a>, as well.</p>\n<p>But, now, let us bury the lead and talk about the most exciting news. We're playing shows in Boston and New York this fall and we'd love to see you there. Details over on the <a href=\"/calendar/\">Shows page</a>. Please join us.</p>\n<p>Now it's time for bed. I gotta help a friend move tomorrow.</p>"

A sincere thank you for listening! It's out in all the usual online outlets but the only place to get the CD, and the best way to get digital (especially if you like FLAC files) is <a href=\"http://hallelujahthehills.bandcamp.com/album/have-you-ever-done-something-evil\">Bandcamp</a>. But hey, if you're on iTunes or Amazon anyway, think about leaving a review. It helps spread the word on the record.</p>\r\n<p>Our California tour has wrapped, and it was phenomenal. Thank you for coming out! If you're a fan of comedy podcasts, you should really check out <a href=\"http://www.earwolf.com/episode/hallelujah-the-hills/\">our episode of Impov4Humans</a> which we recorded in Los Angeles at the Earwolf studios.</p>\r\n<p>If you think we look a little beleaguered in <a href=\"http://blog.earwolf.com/post/87244336643\">these Earwolf studio pictures</a>, there's a good reason. The night before that recording <a href=\"http://www.vanyaland.com/2014/05/22/hallelujah-hills-clothes-band-merch-stolen-last-night-oakland/\">our van was smashed into while we played</a> and they grabbed all of our personal belongings and a box of our CDs. We drove overnight to LA, halfway in a smashed in a van, the other half in a new rental, and I'm pretty sure I can't tell if I drove a leg of the trip or just dreamed I drove a leg of the trip, and that's not good. We arrived just in time to record the Improv4Humans episode. Thieves can't stop HtH (I've always said this, and I'll say it again, it will be an inside job that destroys this band)! We were very thankful that they didn't get our instruments, but we did have to improvise to find some respectable clothes to play the wedding of two lovely fans, scheduled for two days later. In a fevered, rushed trip to the Glendale Galleria, we all bought new clothes to last us the week.&nbsp;Walking into a Target and buying everything you need to be clothed and clean for the near future feels a little bit like entering the witness protection program. It's not ideal, but in the right circumstances, I highly recommend it. In the end, I think we ended up looking pretty sharp at that wedding.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http://hallelujahthehills.com/files/images/hth_wedding_1.jpg\" alt=\"Wedding photos\" /></p>\r\n<p>More California stories and exciting band news soon!</p>"

Let&rsquo;s break that down.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;re recording a new album this fall. It&rsquo;s called <strong>Deluxer Mandatory</strong>. You can check out the track listing and the album cover below. I could describe what it sounds like, but has a band ever done that in a way that you found satisfying? Is it different from other albums but still somehow classically Hallelujah-The-Hills-esque? Yes, but music is ear stuff! You&rsquo;ll need to understand it with your ears!</p>\n<h4>The Great Democratized Pre-Order!</h4>\n<p>For the past two albums we&rsquo;ve covered recording and production costs with Kickstarters, and it&rsquo;s been a small miracle for a band like us. But we also noticed that people who had more to spend got the more exclusive items, which is just the way things sometimes work, but not for this album, we&rsquo;ve decided. We believe we can cover all recording/production costs just via regular ol' pre-sales. <strong>Until November 4th, anyone who pre-orders the album in any format will be entered into a raffle with individual prizes that have been valued up to $500.</strong> We&rsquo;ll host a live-streamed raffle drawing in the spring where we&rsquo;ll draw the winners and your prize will accompany your brand new HTH album. If just a fraction of fans who have bought an HTH album in the past decide to pre-order, this gamble will pay off. Let&rsquo;s try it out! <a href=\"https://hallelujahthehills.bandcamp.com/album/deluxer-mandatory\">PRE-ORDER NOW!</a></p>\n<p><strong>All pre-orders automatically get:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your name in the liner notes</li>\n<li>Early access to the album</li>\n<li>Early access to a chapter of the book</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Raffle Prizes:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Two (2) test pressings of &ldquo;Have You Ever Done Something Evil?&rdquo; vinyl with original one of a kind collage on the front cover</li>\n<li>Two (2) test pressings of &ldquo;Deluxer Mandatory&rdquo; vinyl with original one of a kind collage on the front cover</li>\n<li>Five (5) signed copies of M.

Jonathan Lee</a> complete access to the band and the recording process. Since we feel like we&rsquo;re not a band who is &ldquo;winding down their career,&rdquo; which is when you might normally see a book like this come out, we found Mr. Lee&rsquo;s idea of a book that captures us making this album and how we got here to be an interesting premise. Think of it like a documentary on paper. Here&rsquo;s the author in his own words:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A year or so into becoming a fan of Hallelujah The Hills, I got into dialogue with Ryan Walsh over using some of the band&rsquo;s lyrics in my second novel. From there we had numerous conversations and the idea came about to write a non-fiction piece about the new album they were planning on recording in November 2015, tentatively titled Deluxer Mandatory. I am really interested in how it is that five people work together in a room recording music on that particular day, at that moment in time. Thus, the book begins with the opening of the sessions but ultimately leads backward through time analyzing the choices each member made to ultimately lead to them writing, playing and recording Deluxer Mandatory. As much a biography as a journey, I want it to appeal to any music fan whether they are aware of HTH or not. The title? TBA. Get Me In A Room.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Mr. Lee will be at both of the shows listed below, and he is interested in talking to fans (and enemies) of the band. We hope you&rsquo;ll get a chance to speak with him! The book will be published by Solopreneur Publishing based in West Yorkshire, UK. Lastly, yes, we told him multiple times we are not famous.</p>\n<h4>The Live Shows</h4>\n<p>On sale now!</p>\n<p><strong>Friday November 13</strong> @ Cuisine en Locale, Somerville, MA w/ Landlady, Eternals.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/hallelujah-the-hills-landlady-eternals-tickets-18523694870\">TIX</a></p>\n<p><strong>Saturday November 14</strong> @ Bowery Electric, New York, NY w/ Wilder Maker, Jason Heath &amp; The Greedy Souls.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ticketweb.com/t3/sale/SaleEventDetail?dispatch=loadSelectionData&amp;eventId=6144095&amp;REFERRAL_ID=tmfeed&amp;crosssite=TM_US:2159224:\">TIX</a></p>\n<p>Our album release show in the spring will take place in Boston, likely a two night celebration with several former band members joining us on stage to salute the discography.</p>\n<p>To make a long story short: we&rsquo;re in a great mood, we love making music, and we&rsquo;re about to make more of it.

We wrote the lyrics about Woody Guthrie dreaming about a punk band first, sometime last year, and then we decided it would be fun to create a document and story that made it seem like he actually had done so a few months ago. When we launched this song and the <a href=\"http://www.woodyguthriepredictedpunk.com/\">WoodyGuthriePredictedPunk.com</a> website, we were surprised to see many people sharing the news on social media as if it was real. We thought nothing of it until last week we were visited by two Boston office FBI agents who were curious why we had declassified documents that they had no knowledge of. It wasn't a matter of censoring the news that Woody predicted punk, you see, but more of an issue of access. We immediately came clean and confessed that we had fabricated the document and the story, never believing anyone would take it all that seriously. We are being allowed to keep this website up and running only upon posting this corrective note. We apologize for wasting the Federal Bureau of Investigation's time and apologize to anyone we fooled with our promotional effort.</p>"

WHY. I know why.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The band employed a new method of songwriting to arrive at this short, psychedelic, lyrically-bananas new gem of an entry in our ever-growing discography. Last month we hit record and forced ourselves to improv new instrumental music together, changing it completely every minute or two without discussion. Then the vocal melodies were overdubbed on top of the tracks, arriving at this bizarre, delightful result.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/hallelujahthehills/are-we-failing?in=hallelujahthehills/sets/movement-scorekeepers/s-KFgAw\">&ldquo;Are We Failing?&rdquo;</a>, the first song on the EP, is available for any online sharing starting today. The EP will be out digitally and on a <a href=\"http://www.jealousbutcher.com/products/movement-scorekeepers-ep\">limited-edition blue 7\"</a> but not on CD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/dgojqlr7m/image/upload/c_scale,w_480/v1464048487/movement_scorekeepers.jpg\" alt=\"Movement Scorekeepers cover\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, the full-length <cite>A Band Is Something To Figure Out</cite> vinyl is gorgeous, shipping SOON, and we&rsquo;ll have plenty of these at live shows. But why wait? Get it from <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1lbE9mU\">Re-Vinyl Records</a>.</p>"
